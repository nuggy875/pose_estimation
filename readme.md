This repository contains the code for our work **iSPA-NET**, accepted in ACM Multimedia Conference, 2018 (ACMMM18).

![results](misc/acmmm_results.png)


This repository is broadly divided into two parts:

1) Data Creation

2) iSPA-Net Training and Testing code

3) Pretrained Weights: run download\_pretrained\_weights.sh


**Note:** For the Universal Correspondence Network, code for which has to be requested from [NEC-Labs](http://www.nec-labs.com/~mas/UCN/).
